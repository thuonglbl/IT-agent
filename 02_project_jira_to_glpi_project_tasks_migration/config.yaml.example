# Jira Projects to GLPI Project Tasks Migration - Project-Specific Configuration
# ================================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Common settings (GLPI credentials, Jira credentials, logging)
# are in ../common/config.yaml - update that file first!
# This file only contains settings unique to project task migration.

# ===== Jira Configuration (Project-Specific) =====
jira:
  # Project Key to migrate (in URL, after projectKey=)
  project_key: "MYPROJECT"

  # JQL query for issues to migrate
  jql: "project = MYPROJECT ORDER BY key ASC"

  # Custom Fields Mapping
  # Map custom field names to Jira field IDs (customfield_XXXXX)
  # Go to Project Settings > Fields > select schema > hover on "X screens" to get IDs

  # Color Mapping for Project States
  # Jira API returns color names (success, inprogress, default), GLPI expects hex values
  color_map:
    success: "#00875A"      # Green
    inprogress: "#0052CC"   # Blue
    default: "#42526E"      # Gray

# ===== GLPI Configuration (Project-Specific) =====
glpi:
  # Target project name in GLPI (must match exactly or be found via search)
  project_name: "My GLPI Project Name"

# Migration Settings (Project-Specific)
migration:
  # State file to track migration progress
  state_file: "migration_state.json"

  # ID mapping file for sub-task to parent task linkage
  # DO NOT delete this file - it stores Jira Key → GLPI ID mappings
  mapping_file: "jira_glpi_id_map.json"
